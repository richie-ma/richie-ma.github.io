excerpt: '--- **Abstract**: Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) employs implied functionality primarily to link single-contract (outright) and calendar spread markets, eliminating price inconsistencies between outright and spread markets, and to facilitate additional cross-market liquidity. We examine how implied functionality in CME corn and soybean futures markets affects market quality in outright markets, focusing on these contracts due to their higher proportion of implied liquidity and greater analytical tractability. Constructing a counterfactual that excludes implied liquidity, we find that implied liquidity is associated with reduced market-making revenue and heightened adverse selection risk for liquidity providers, while having minimal impact on liquidity takers. This study suggests that the common goal of preserving tight spread and deep depth may not be optimal in the context of agricultural futures trading.'
