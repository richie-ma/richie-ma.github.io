title: "cmemdp: Clean and Analyze Chicago Mercantile Exchange Market Data in Python"
excerpt: "--- Author: Richie R. Ma <br/><br/> --- The Python package `cmemdp` is inspired by the R package `cme.mdp`. The `cmemdp` covers almost all features in that package and it also includes other important functions, e.g., CME Packet Capture (PCAP) data cleaning. <br/><br/> ---Market microstructure researcher can rely on the PCAP data parser to obtain huge amount of market data not only in a single futures market, where both MBP and MBO data are included. This is a cost-efficient way to acquire more data to support possible cross-market analyses, such as soybean complex. No strong prior knowledge is needed for the PCAP data. <br/><br/> --- Check more details in the GitHub repo: https://github.com/richie-ma/cmemdp"
