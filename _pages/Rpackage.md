# cme.mdp: Clean and Analyze Chicago Mercantile Exchange Market Data in R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Authors: Richie R. Ma and Brian G. Peterson

The goal of cme.mdp is to clean Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market
data with FIX protocol more easily in the R environment, including but
not limited to trade summaries, quote updates, and limit order book
reconstruction.

## Introduction

Financial markets have become more transparent and exchanges can provide
high-frequency data for traders to better monitor markets, which creates
more demand about the high-frequency data usage both in the academia and
industry. Most exchanges do not disseminate tabulated complete market
data to non-member market participants, and almost all market data are
specially coded to enhance the communication efficiency. Thus, financial
economists need to know how to clean these untabulated data at first,
which is a substantially time-consuming task. This project will closely
focus on how to parse and clean the market data of Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) under the FIX and MDP protocols and provide other
statistical procedures related to market liquidity (in later version).

## CME market data overview

So far, there have been Market by Price (MBP) data which aggregates all
individual order information (e.g., size) at every price level, and
Market by Order (MBO) data that can show all individual order details
(e.g., order priority) at each price level. The MBO data also provide
more information about trade summaries than the MBP, so that traders are
able to know which limit orders are matched in each trade and their
corresponding matching quantities. The detailed trade summaries also
assign the trade direction more precisely than the MBP and no quote
merge is required for almost all trades. In general, CME will
disseminate the MBP incremental updates followed by the order-level
details (e.g., submission, cancellation) that describes the reason for
MBP updates. Our package considers the above characters and can process
both the MBP and MBO data including quote messages and trade summaries.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cme.mdp from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") #Install the 'devtools' package if you haven't
devtools::install_github("richie-ma/cme.mdp")
```

## Trade summary: MBP and MBO

### MBP trade summary

This is a basic example which shows you how to extract trade summary
messages from the raw data. CME MDP data disseminate trade summary
messages with trade price, trade size, number of orders, and trade
aggressor (direction) for most of trades. Trades that are matched with
implied orders might not have an explicit aggressor from the CME.

CME does not necessarily display the price as what we see from the
Bloomberg Terminal or others and users need to know the display format
of the trade price prior to using `trade_summary()` function. Otherwise,
a Sunday’s input needs to be given to extract this information.

``` r

library(cme.mdp)

gold_trades <- trade_summary(
  mbp_input = "R:/xcec_md_gc_fut_20200102-r-00390.gz",
  date = '2020-01-02',
  price_displayformat = 0.1

### MBO trade summary with order details

CME MBO data further provide the order details for each trade, including
both incoming (market) order and matching (limit) orders. For each trade
summary, the first row shows the information of the incoming (market)
order and the rest rows show the information of matching (limit) orders.

For each trade, the MBO data assign a unique trade ID and users can know
the matched quantity of each matching (limit) order. Generally, the
matched quantity of the incomding (market) order eqauls to the sum of
matched quantity of all matching (limit) orders when implied orders are
not involved in each trade.

``` r
## The sample data is COMEX gold futures on October 25, 2017

gold_trades_orders <- mbo_match_details(
  mbo_input = "R:/xcec_md_gc_fut.gz",

## Quote messages: MBP and MBO

### MBP quote messages

CME MBP quote messages show quote updates at each book depth and all
relevant order management is based on the limit order book. The updates
include submissions, modifications, and cancellations. CME MBP data
disseminate quoted price, quoted quantity, and the number of orders in
the queue for each book depth, etc. The MBP quote messages can be used
directly to reconstruct the limit order book.

``` r

## Example: corn futures on March 12, 2020
## We only use a part of the original data for illustrative purposes

corn_quotes <- quote_message(mbp_input = "R:/xcbt_md_zc_fut_20200312-r-00348",
                             date = '2020-03-12',
                             price_displayformat = 1)

### MBO quote messages with queues

CME MBO data can further provide order queues for each quote message
included in the MBP. The MBO data can also show all limit order
information, including order ID, order size, and order priority, etc.

``` r
## The sample data is COMEX gold futures on October 25, 2017
## Sample data can be downloaded at CME website

sp500_quotes_orders <- mbo_quote_queue(
  mbo_input = "R:/xcme_md_es_fut.gz",

## Order book

### Reconstruction: Pseudo code

The limit order book reconstruction is based on the quote messages for
each single tradeable contract. When the quote update is addition, one
needs to move the existing book depths backward and insert information
(e.g., price, quantity, number of orders). When the quote update is
modification, one just needs to revise the information of that book
depth. Finally, when the quote update is cancellation, one needs to move
the existing book depths forward and nullify the last depth in the book.
Motivated by Christensen and Woodmansey (2013), a pseudocode is shown as
follows:

<figure>
<img src="man/figures/algo1.png" alt="Algorithm 1" />
</figure>

In terms of consolidated limit order book, the function makes each book
contains all records in both outright and implied books, fill missing
values with last observation carrying forward (locf). Then, the initial
consolidated book is set to be the same of the outright limit order
book. For each record in the implied book, we compare the prices of each
implied book record to those in the consolidated book. When the implied
prices are in the existing prices in the consolidated book, we add the
implied quantity to the corresponding depth in the consolidated book.
Otherwise, the implied prices will be sorted with the existing prices in
the consolidated book, with possible book moving if applicable. A
pseudocode is shown as follows:

<figure>
<img src="man/figures/algo2.png" alt="Algorithm 2" />
</figure>

### Feature: Anmiated order book visualization

This package also provides an animated order book application for users
and now only supports `book_bar()` function. Users can simply set
`animation` to `TRUE` and the function will return the animated order
book. Users can also adjust the FPS (frame per second) to control the
animation playing speed. One example is given as below.
