[**Is liquidity provision informative? Evidence from agricultural futures markets**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajae.12479) with [**Teresa Serra**](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/tserra), ***American Journal of Agricultural Economics***, January 2025
* <span style="font-size:16px;">**Abstract**: Electronic commodity trading witnesses a massive volume of order messages every trading day, but little is known about their informativeness. We examine limit order dynamics and their role in price discovery in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) corn, soybean, and wheat futures markets from January 2019 to June 2020, using order-level data. Between 75% and 79% of the large number of limit orders submitted are then deleted, which contrasts with the much smaller proportion getting executed or revised. Aggressive trades and limit orders substantially contribute to price discovery, whereas nonaggressive trades and limit orders, representing most market events, play a minor role. Following public information releases, there is a shift in trading strategies, with trades contributing more to price discovery and aggressive limit orders contributing less, compared to non-release days. Our findings suggest that most limit orders in agricultural futures markets continue to play the traditional role of uninformed liquidity provision.</span>

**One-tick futures: Does tick size reduction better markets?** with Teresa Serra
* <span style="font-size:16px;">**Abstract**: This paper examines tick size reduction in the U.S. 2-year Treasury Note futures market around January 14, 2019. We employ a difference-in-differences regression with 5-, 10-, and ultra 10-year Treasury futures markets as control groups, and we generally find significantly improved market quality. Trading costs reduce for liquidity takers and the smaller tick size has limited ability to relax its binding constraint. Our mechanism analyses indicate that traders significantly withdraw less liquidity after undercutting in response to non-execution risks and when they react to snipping risks at the opposite side of undercutting orders. Moreover, we find traders do not shift to market orders to acquire immediacy. Conversely, significantly fewer trades after undercutting. The smaller tick size significantly changes the quoting behavior, where depths are dispersed through the new pricing grid, suggesting that traders can post price-improving quotes and limit orders are layered in a more granular pricing grid, with limit order size significantly becoming smaller. Last, trading volume does not significantly change, while more trades occur with smaller trade size. Pricing efficiency does not significantly change neither does price discovery. Our findings suggest that reducing the tick size in tick-constrained liquid futures market could be promising.</span>
