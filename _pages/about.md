## News
* The R package `cme.mdp` coauthored with Brian Peterson has been published in my [Github](https://github.com/richie-ma/cme.mdp). Comments and Suggestions are welcomed!

* I have mirrored the R package `cme.mdp` to a Python package `cmemdp`. This package includes all features in the R `cme.mdp` and I also provide a parser for the CME raw dataset, Packet Capture (PCAP) data. It has been published in my [Github repo](https://github.com/richie-ma/cmemdp). Comments and Suggestions are welcomed!
